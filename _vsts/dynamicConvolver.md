    <p>The Dynamic Convolver was my final thesis project for my undergraduate course at Berklee. I was inspired to make this after learning about convolution, and how easy it was to implement within Csound.</p>
    <p>Convolution is a complex algorithm that takes to arrays and operates on them in such a way that it "morphs" them into one another. In audio, since audio files are simply arrays, we can do this just as easily. The result has commonly been used to emulate reverbs with an Impulse Response file, but for this project, I wanted to allow for more creative uses of the convolution process.</p>
    <p>This convolution plugin is unique in that it allows the user to highlight selected portions of the convolution audio file and alter it in real-time, creating interesting dynamic results.</p>
    <p>It also features many other processing effects both before and after the convolution process, including a compressor and equalizer for tuning the often explosive results you can get.</p>
