    <p>The Mapping Sequencer is a simple Max4Live device that allows a global sequencer to control up to 16? different mappable parameters within Live.</p>
    <p>t was inspired by the other mappable Max4Live devices built into Ableton Live. Having found those very useful, I wanted to build a similar mapping device, but have it controlled by a sequencer. Thus, I created the Mapping Sequencer.</p>
    <p>It features a 16 step GUI for drawing individual values for each step. Using the drop down menu, you can map the sequence to various parameters. Individual scaling of each mapping allows for inverting and other variations between mappings</p>
