    <p>I created this plugin one day after I was wanting a device that would allow me to craft my own drum samples, since I found it very time consuming to make my own through other softwares. This gave the idea for a plugin that was dedicated to making drum samples; thus, the pulse drum designer was born.</p>
    <p>This plugin features many basic synthesis methods that can be combined to create basic mono drum samples. Along with the transient shaper, these methods allow for creating some unique percussive noises.</p>
