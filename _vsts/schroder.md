    <p>I made this plugin while I was learning the basic of Cabbage plugin design and thought that emulation of an early digital reverb would make a great starting project. The emulated reverb in this plugin is objectively very cheap sounded, and pales in comparison to modern reverb emulations, however the cheap sound creates interesting effects in itself and can be very fun to try on many audio sources.</p>
