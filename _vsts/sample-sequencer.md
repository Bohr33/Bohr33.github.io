    <p>The Sample Sequencer is a Max4Live device that allows for controlling the splicing of and manipulation of an uploaded audio file via an 8 step sequencer. This device was inspired by some of the unique, stuttering effect produced by artist who incorperate unique sampling operations into their music. This sound, combined with my love of sequencers, inspired me to create this instrument.</p>
    <p>Along with basic sequencing features, this devices allows for indpendant control of playback speed, sequencer duration, gain, and sample position for each individual steps. Furthermore, the onscreen display will preview the location for each step, allowing for precise control of the step's playback position.</p>
