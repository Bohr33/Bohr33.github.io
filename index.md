Welcome to my developer website. This site is meant to highlight my work as a developer and audio programmer. Feel free to browse around my site and check out some of my work, many of which are available to download at my github.

A large aspect of my development work involves working with audio plugins, because of this, I have a dedicated a section of this website to highlighting these. Many of these can also be downloaded for free by visiting my Github page. 

I love collaborating on and talking about any type of work involving music and audio so if you have any questions or other inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out.
