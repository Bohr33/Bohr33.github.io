## Welcome
I’m an audio developer and sound designer exploring the intersection of music, technology, and digital creativity.

This website showcases my work in audio software development, sound design, and research in digital signal processing. Here you’ll find a collection of my VST plugins, open-source projects, and research experiments — all centered around creative approaches to sound.

If you’re interested in exploring my latest tools, you can start with my [plugin collection]({{ '/plugins/' | relative_url }}), or check out some of my [recent projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}).
