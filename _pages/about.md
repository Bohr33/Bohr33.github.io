Hello! I’m an audio developer, researcher, and musician interested in building creative digital instruments, effects, and sound tools. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronic Production and Design from Berklee College of Music, where I explored sound design through digital programming using tools such as Max/MSP, Csound, and C/C++.

Fascinated by digital signal processing (DSP) and its potential for expressive sound manipulation, I continued my studies at Maynooth University, earning a Master’s degree in Music and Sound Computing. Currently, my goal is to apply these skills in real-world contexts, either as a developer, researcher, or sound designer, to create tools that inspire new ways of making and interacting with sound.


## Developer
As a developer, my work centers on creating digital audio tools for musicians and sound designers. My early experiments with Max/MSP and Csound during my undergraduate studies sparked my interest in DSP and real-time sound synthesis.

Today, I primarily develop in C and C++, using frameworks such as JUCE for plugin creation and working with microcontrollers like the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Bela for embedded audio systems.

Many of my audio projects are available on my GitHub, and you can explore my collection of plugins [here](https://bohr33.github.io/plugins/).


## Musician

As a musician, I’m interested in both performance and composition. I grew up playing drums in symphonic and jazz ensembles, a passion I continued throughout college. My time in the Electronic Production and Design program also introduced me to electronic musical performance, which inspired me to begin composing and performing electronic music of my own.

I now create and perform original electronic music using custom-built systems and effects that I design myself. Alongside that, I continue to play drums and piano, though I’m not currently involved in any major performance projects. I occasionally release new music, which you can find on my other website, [here](https://bwaudio.netlify.app/) .
