## Hi, I'm Ben
I’m a developer, sound designer, and musician with a background in music technology and creative coding. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronic Production and Design at Berklee College of Music, as well as a master’s degree in Sound and Music Computing.

My work focuses on creating audio tools, plugins, and interactive systems that merge technology with creativity. I primarily use languages and tools such as C, C++, JUCE, Csound, and Max/MSP for most audio work, but have experience with more general languages like Python as well.






My primary interest in developing with audio

Why intersted in digital audio?
- I;m interested in creating plugins that create new and unique intersting sounds, as well as developing creative interfaces that give users an unique perspective on their instrument.

- I'm intersted in creating tools that inspire the user, and make it easy for them to  

I enjoy tackling projects that merge technical precision with artistic expression. This often includes creating experimental instruments to implementing DSP algorithms and real-time visual/audio systems.

I’m passionate about designing tools that empower musicians, researchers, and creators, and I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects in audio and software development.
