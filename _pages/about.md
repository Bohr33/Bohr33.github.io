## Hi, I'm Ben
I’m a developer and sound designer with a background in music technology and creative coding. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronic Production and Design at Berklee College of Music, as well as a master’s degree in Sound and Music Computing.

My work focuses on creating audio tools, plugins, and interactive systems that merge technology with creativity. I have experience developing in C++, CMake, OpenGL, PortAudio, Max/MSP, Csound, and JUCE, and I also enjoy exploring machine learning as a way to expand creative possibilities in music.

I enjoy tackling projects that merge technical precision with artistic expression. This often includes creating experimental instruments to implementing DSP algorithms and real-time visual/audio systems.

I’m passionate about designing tools that empower musicians, researchers, and creators, and I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on innovative projects in audio and software development.
